# Black magic cake

- flour - 1 3/4 cup
- sugar - 1 3/4 cup
- cocoa - 3/4 cup
- baking powder - 1 tsp
- baking soda - 1 tsp
- vanilla extract - 2 tsp
- chocolate extract - 2 tsp
- salt - 1 tsp
- buttermilk - 1 cup
- oil - 1/2 cup
- eggs - 2
- espresso - 1 or 2

Mix the hot water with the instant coffee and let it cool off a little. We don’t want to end up with scrambled eggs.

In the mixer bowl you combine the sieved flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt. In a separate bowl you combine the buttermilk, eggs, vegetable oil, vanilla and chocolate extract and the instant coffee.

While you run the mixer at a low-speed you slowly pour the liquid mix in with the dry ingredients. Let the mixer run at a medium speed for about 3 to 4 minutes. That’s it.

Line a standard muffin tin with paper liners and fill them halfway up with the batter and bake them for 20 minutes at 350F (175C), until a tooth pick stuck in the center comes out clean.

This recipe makes for 24 cupcakes. If you want to make a layered cake use two 9-inch x 2-inch cake pans (not the 8-inch pans Ina says because it will bubble out of the pan and mess up your oven).

For one large cake you use a 13-inch x 2-inch round cake pan.
