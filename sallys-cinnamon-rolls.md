# Sally's cinnamon rolls

Rolls:
- flour - 2 3/4 cups
- sugar - 3 tbsp
- salt - 1 tsp
- yeast - 2 1/4 tsp
- water - 1/2 cup
- milk - 1/4 cup
- butter - 40 g
- egg - 1

Filling:
- butter - 40 g
- cinnamon - 2 tbsp
- sugar - 1/2 cup

Set aside 1/2 cup of flour. In a large bowl, toss the 2 and 1/4 cups flour, the sugar, salt, and yeast together until evenly dispersed. Set aside.

Heat the water, milk, and butter together in the microwave until the butter is melted and the mixture is hot to touch. About 46°C. Stir the butter mixture into the flour mixture. Add the egg and only enough of the reserved flour to make a soft dough. Dough will be ready when it gently pulls away from the side of the bowl and has an elastic consistency.

On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough for about 3-4 minutes. Place in a lightly greased bowl and let rest for about 10 minutes.

After 10 minutes, roll the dough out in a 14x8 inch rectangle. Spread the softened butter on top. Mix together the cinnamon and sugar and sprinkle it all over the dough. Add more cinnamon/sugar if desired. Roll up the dough tightly. Cut into 11-12 even pieces and place in a lightly greased 9-inch round pan. I used a pie dish, lightly sprayed with nonstick spray.

Loosely cover the rolls with aluminum foil and allow to rise in a warm, draft-free place for 60-90 minutes. Here is what I do: heat the oven to 93°C. Turn oven off. Place rolls inside oven and allow to rise.

After the rolls have doubled in size, preheat the oven to 190°C. Bake for 25 minutes until lightly browned. I covered the rolls with aluminum foil after 10 minutes to avoid heavy browning.
